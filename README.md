# Airline Customer Satisfaction Analysis with Decision Tree

This project focuses on analyzing airline customer satisfaction data using a Decision Tree classifier. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation to understand and predict customer satisfaction levels.

## Key Features:

1. **Imported File**: Loaded the dataset for airline customer satisfaction.
2. **Checked for Null Values**: Identified missing values in the dataset.
3. **Handled Null Values**: Processed and filled missing values to prepare the data for analysis.
4. **Satisfaction Labeling**: Labeled satisfaction column values without using any encoding methods.
5. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Customer Satisfaction Plot**: Plotted the number of satisfied vs. unsatisfied customers to visualize the distribution.
6. **Mean Value Analysis**:
   - **Gender-Based Satisfaction**: Calculated the mean satisfaction value for male and female customers.
   - **Age-Based Satisfaction**: Determined the mean satisfaction value with respect to age.
   - **Food and Drink Satisfaction**: Analyzed the mean satisfaction value concerning food and drink services.
7. **Decision Tree Model**:
   - Applied a Decision Tree classifier to predict customer satisfaction based on various features.
